  <ul>
    <li>Modular coding approach for better organization, management, and extensibility of the codebase.</li>
    <li>Advanced algorithms to analyze various attributes such as genre, actors, directors, and plot.</li>
    <li>Seamless backend processing to deliver accurate and relevant movie recommendations.</li>
    <li>Tailored movie suggestions to enhance your movie-watching journey.</li>
    <li>Curated selection of movies that resonate with your taste.</li>
